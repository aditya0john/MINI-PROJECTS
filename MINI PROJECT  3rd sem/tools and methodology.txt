TOOLS AND METHODOLOGY:-

BASIC TOOLS THAT I HAVE USED TO ACHIEVE THE WORKING OF THIS PROJECT ARE: 
	1. WORKING ENVIRONMENT:  CODEBLOCKS
	2. APPROACH             : DIVIDE AND CONQUERE
	3. LANGUAGE             : C++

	
METHODOLOGY FOLLOWED:
IN THE PROJECT I HAVE USED SOME LIBRAIREâ€™S (STRING.H, ALGORITHMS.H, CTYPE.H) TO HANDLE STRINGS IN A BETTER NON-COMPLEX WAY 
AND I HAVE DIVIDE MY PROBLEMS AND MADE A FUNCTION FOR EACH TYPE. MOSTLY AN ALGORITHM IS USED TO ACHIEVE THE WORKING OF THE PROJECT COMBINED WITH SOME PRE-DEFINED FUNCTIONS TO MAKE WORKING ON STRINGS EASIER AND USE OF SOME FILE HANDLING.
